# Flufflip
Fluff Flip. An interactive double or nothing game wagering BNB on the Binance Smart Chain. A product created and ran by the Fluff Inu Community. 

# Game Details
Players will wager on coin flips using BNB. The coin flip is a 50/50 random outcome that is provably fair, using Oracle to generate a random event, measuring the outcome, and producing a result. Victorious players will receive double their initial wager, while losing players will lose their initial wager. This creates a "double or nothing" game. Revenues generated from transaction fees will go directly to benefit holders of Fluff Inu token.  

# Transaction Fee
All flips of the coin will be subject to a 4% transaction fee, charged and paid with the initial wager. 

# Wagering Details
Max wager for all flips will be initially set with .1 BNB, with this number set to grow over time. The max wager will always be set at about 5% of the balance of the house wallet, to ensure the long term sustainability of the game. 

# Revenue Model 
The 4% revenue will be directed to 4 seperate wallets. 
 
 1% to sustainability causes

 1% to Fluff Inu Holder Wallet
 
 1% to grow the house Wallet
 
 1% to token burn Wallet. 

# Sustainability 
Fluff Inu will be purchasing trees to be planted and carbon offsets with the 1% sustainability proceeds from Fluff Flip. 

# Token Burn and Dividends
Dividends from Fluff Flip will be paid out to holders of Fluff Inu token. FluffFlip.sol handles token distribution of BNB. A minimum amount of Fluff Inu will be required in order to receive payouts from the dividends. A snapshot will be taken when the holder wallet reaches the threshold balance and the BNB will be reflected to holders at this time. 
On a daily basis, BNB from the Burn Wallet will be used to purchase Fluff Inu tokens. The Purchased Fluff Inu will then be sent to the burn wallet, providing a deflationary mechanism to benefit the Fluff Inu token.
